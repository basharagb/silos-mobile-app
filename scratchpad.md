# Mobile Silo Monitoring - Task Progress

## Current Task: Weather Station and Vertical Silo Layout

### Task Description
Implement a mobile interface with:
- Weather station at the top
- Silo groups displayed vertically with each group showing:
  - Silo Sensors panel
  - Grain Level panel
- Replicate the logic from the React version at `/Users/macbookair/Downloads/silos/replica-view-studio`

### Analysis of React Implementation
From the React code analysis:
- `WeatherCottage.tsx` provides a beautiful weather station with inside/outside temperature
- `useCottageTemperature.ts` handles live temperature readings from slave_id 21 (inside) and 22 (outside)
- `realTimeSensorService.ts` and `useLiveSensorData.ts` manage live silo sensor readings
- Layout shows weather station at top-right, then silo groups below

### Current Mobile Implementation Status
- ✅ Weather station widget exists but positioned at bottom
- ✅ Silo groups are displayed horizontally
- ✅ Silo sensors and grain level panels exist on the right side
- ❌ Need to reorganize to vertical layout with weather at top
- ❌ Need to add silo sensors and grain level for each group

### Task Plan
- [x] Create new branch for this feature
- [x] Move weather station to top of the interface
- [x] Restructure layout to be vertical instead of horizontal
- [x] Add silo sensors panel for each silo group
- [x] Add grain level panel for each silo group
- [x] Ensure live readings work properly
- [x] Test the interface
- [x] Write unit tests
- [x] Commit changes and create PR

### ✅ PREVIOUS TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**Branch:** `feature/vertical-weather-silo-layout`
**Commit:** 87c5cad - "feat: Implement vertical layout with weather station at top"

## NEW TASK: Auto-Test with Progress Indicators and Pagination

### Task Description
Implement auto-test functionality that:
- Scans all silos automatically (24 seconds per silo)
- Shows circular progress indicators on each silo during scanning
- Implements pagination to show one silo group at a time
- Tracks disconnected silos and retries them
- Provides visual feedback for scanning progress

### Analysis from React Implementation
- Auto-test scans all 195 silos with 24-second intervals
- Uses `setCurrentScanSilo()` to track currently scanning silo
- Shows progress indicators and retry logic for disconnected silos
- Persistent state management with localStorage
- Progress bar shows overall completion percentage

### Task Plan
- [x] Create new branch for auto-test feature
- [x] Implement pagination for silo groups (one group per page)
- [x] Add circular progress indicators for scanning silos
- [x] Implement auto-test controller with 24-second intervals
- [x] Add progress tracking and retry logic for disconnected silos
- [x] Update UI to show scanning status and progress
- [x] Test the auto-test functionality
- [x] Write unit tests
- [x] Commit changes and create PR

### ✅ PREVIOUS TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**Branch:** `feature/auto-test-pagination-progress`
**Commit:** 71f56f7 - "feat: Implement auto-test with pagination and progress indicators"
**PR:** https://github.com/basharagb/silos-mobile/pull/new/feature/auto-test-pagination-progress

## NEW TASK: Automatic Monitoring System with 3-Minute Intervals

### Task Description
Implement an automatic monitoring system that:
- Performs automatic checks every 3 minutes for all silos
- Completes all silo checks in less than 3 seconds (fast batch checking)
- Caches silo colors and readings automatically
- Updates individual silo data when clicked (on-demand updates)
- Removes manual/automatic check buttons (unified system)
- Maintains real-time visual feedback

### Current System Analysis ✅
- **API Structure**: Uses `ApiService.getSiloSensorData()` with 10s timeout, returns `SiloSensorData` with sensors, colors, maxTemp
- **Caching**: `_siloDataCache` Map<int, SiloSensorData> in LiveReadingsInterface, AlertsCache for alerts (1 hour cache)
- **Auto-test**: `AutoTestController` scans 195 silos sequentially with 24s per silo (total ~78 minutes)
- **Manual checks**: Individual silo scanning with 1.5s delay, shows blue color during scan
- **Current Issues**:
  - Auto-test takes 78 minutes (too slow)
  - Manual/auto buttons exist (need to remove)
  - No 3-minute interval system
  - Sequential scanning instead of batch checking

### Task Plan
- [x] Create new branch for automatic monitoring feature
- [x] Analyze current system architecture and API structure
- [x] Understand existing caching mechanisms
- [x] Design fast batch checking system (< 3 seconds for all silos)
- [x] Implement 3-minute automatic interval system
- [x] Implement on-demand silo updates when clicked
- [x] Remove manual/automatic check buttons
- [x] Update caching strategy for colors and readings
- [x] Test performance and timing requirements
- [x] Write unit tests
- [x] Commit changes and create PR

### ✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**Branch:** `feature/automatic-monitoring-3min`
**Commit:** 653c7da - "feat: Implement automatic monitoring system with 3-minute intervals"
**PR:** https://github.com/basharagb/silos-mobile-app/pull/new/feature/automatic-monitoring-3min

### ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **AutomaticMonitoringService**: Singleton service that performs batch checks every 3 minutes
- **Fast Batch Checking**: Uses `/readings/avg/latest/batch` endpoint with 3-second timeout
- **Fallback System**: Falls back to concurrent individual requests if batch API fails
- **Smart Caching**: Caches silo data with freshness tracking (5-minute fresh window)
- **On-Demand Updates**: Individual silo updates when clicked, with immediate cache update
- **Unified Interface**: Removed manual/auto test buttons, replaced with monitoring status indicator
- **Real-time Status**: Shows monitoring status, cache stats, and last check time
- **Performance Optimized**: All 195 silos checked in <3 seconds using concurrent requests

**Technical Details:**
- Monitoring interval: 3 minutes (as requested)
- Batch timeout: 3 seconds (as requested)
- Cache freshness: 5 minutes
- Total silos: 195 (all groups)
- API endpoints: Batch endpoint with fallback to individual endpoints
- State management: Uses ChangeNotifier for real-time UI updates

### Implementation Details
- Successfully restructured LiveReadingsInterface to vertical layout
- Weather station now positioned at the top of the interface
- Created `_buildSiloGroupWithPanels()` method that combines:
  - Silo group card display
  - Silo Sensors panel for each group
  - Grain Level panel for each group
- Each group is properly labeled (Group 1-10)
- Maintained all existing functionality for silo selection and live readings
- Control panel moved to top for better accessibility

## Lessons
- Weather station uses slave_id 21 for inside temp and 22 for outside temp
- Real-time updates should refresh every 30 seconds for weather, 15-30 seconds for silo data
- Temperature status: -127.0 = disconnected, <-50 or >60 = error, <0 or >50 = warning
- **Automatic Monitoring**: 3-minute intervals with <3s batch checking is optimal for 195 silos
- **Batch API**: Use `/readings/avg/latest/batch?silo_numbers=1,2,3...` for fast bulk operations
- **Concurrent Requests**: When batch fails, use Future.wait() for concurrent individual requests
- **Cache Strategy**: 5-minute freshness window prevents unnecessary API calls while maintaining accuracy
- **On-demand Updates**: Individual silo clicks should trigger immediate updates for better UX
