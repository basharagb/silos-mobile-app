# Mobile Silo Monitoring - Task Progress

## Current Task: Weather Station and Vertical Silo Layout

### Task Description
Implement a mobile interface with:
- Weather station at the top
- Silo groups displayed vertically with each group showing:
  - Silo Sensors panel
  - Grain Level panel
- Replicate the logic from the React version at `/Users/macbookair/Downloads/silos/replica-view-studio`

### Analysis of React Implementation
From the React code analysis:
- `WeatherCottage.tsx` provides a beautiful weather station with inside/outside temperature
- `useCottageTemperature.ts` handles live temperature readings from slave_id 21 (inside) and 22 (outside)
- `realTimeSensorService.ts` and `useLiveSensorData.ts` manage live silo sensor readings
- Layout shows weather station at top-right, then silo groups below

### Current Mobile Implementation Status
- ✅ Weather station widget exists but positioned at bottom
- ✅ Silo groups are displayed horizontally
- ✅ Silo sensors and grain level panels exist on the right side
- ❌ Need to reorganize to vertical layout with weather at top
- ❌ Need to add silo sensors and grain level for each group

### Task Plan
- [x] Create new branch for this feature
- [x] Move weather station to top of the interface
- [x] Restructure layout to be vertical instead of horizontal
- [x] Add silo sensors panel for each silo group
- [x] Add grain level panel for each silo group
- [x] Ensure live readings work properly
- [x] Test the interface
- [x] Write unit tests
- [x] Commit changes and create PR

- [x] Implement pagination for silo groups (one group per page)
- [x] Add circular progress indicators for scanning silos
- [x] Implement auto-test controller with 24-second intervals
- [x] Add progress tracking and retry logic for disconnected silos
- [x] Update UI to show scanning status and progress
- [x] Test the auto-test functionality
- [x] Write unit tests
- [x] Commit changes and create PR

## NEW TASK: Automatic Monitoring System with 3-Minute Intervals

### Task Description
Implement an automatic monitoring system that:
- Performs automatic checks every 3 minutes for all silos
- Completes all silo checks in less than 3 seconds (fast batch checking)
- Caches silo colors and readings automatically
- Updates individual silo data when clicked (on-demand updates)
- Removes manual/automatic check buttons (unified system)
- Maintains real-time visual feedback

### Current System Analysis ✅
- **API Structure**: Uses `ApiService.getSiloSensorData()` with 10s timeout, returns `SiloSensorData` with sensors, colors, maxTemp
- **Caching**: `_siloDataCache` Map<int, SiloSensorData> in LiveReadingsInterface, AlertsCache for alerts (1 hour cache)
- **Auto-test**: `AutoTestController` scans 195 silos sequentially with 24s per silo (total ~78 minutes)
- **Manual checks**: Individual silo scanning with 1.5s delay, shows blue color during scan
- **Current Issues**:
  - Auto-test takes 78 minutes (too slow)
  - Manual/auto buttons exist (need to remove)
  - No 3-minute interval system
  - Sequential scanning instead of batch checking

### Task Plan
- [x] Create new branch for automatic monitoring feature
- [x] Analyze current system architecture and API structure
- [x] Understand existing caching mechanisms
- [x] Design fast batch checking system (< 3 seconds for all silos)
- [x] Implement 3-minute automatic interval system
- [x] Implement on-demand silo updates when clicked
- [x] Remove manual/automatic check buttons
- [x] Update caching strategy for colors and readings
- [x] Test performance and timing requirements
- [x] Write unit tests
- [x] Commit changes and create PR

### ✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**Branch:** `feature/automatic-monitoring-3min`
**Latest Commit:** 8cd02e0 - "fix: Make pagination buttons clickable and add debug logging"
**PR:** https://github.com/basharagb/silos-mobile-app/pull/new/feature/automatic-monitoring-3min

### ✅ FINAL SILO DISPLAY LOGIC IMPLEMENTED

**Silo Color Logic (As Requested):**
- **Unscanned Silos**: Wheat color (yellowish like wheat grain) with silo number
- **Scanned Silos**: API color with silo number
- **Scanning State**: Blue color with circular progress indicator and pulsing animation
- **On-Click**: Calls API, updates values, shows scanning process with visual indicators

**Visual Feedback:**
- Circular progress ring during scanning
- Pulsing animation for scanning silos
- Smart text contrast (auto-adjusts based on background color)
- Status indicator dots for different states
- Smooth color transitions

### ✅ INITIAL SCAN ON APP LAUNCH IMPLEMENTED

**Initial Scan Features:**
- **Auto-start**: Begins automatically after login/app launch
- **Sequential Scanning**: 1 second per silo (195 silos total)
- **Real-time Progress**: Shows current silo being scanned
- **Visual Indicators**: Blue scanner icon, progress bar, completion counter
- **Seamless Transition**: Switches to 3-minute monitoring after completion

**Scan Process:**
1. App launches → Splash screen
2. Login/Authentication
3. Live Readings opens
4. Initial scan starts immediately (1s per silo)
5. Shows scanning progress with visual feedback
6. After scan completes → Regular 3-minute monitoring begins

### ✅ PAGINATION BUTTONS FIXED

**Clickable Navigation:**
- **Numbered Buttons**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... 10 (all clickable)
- **Arrow Buttons**: Previous (⬅️) and Next (➡️) navigation
- **Quick Navigation**: "First" and "Last" buttons for fast access
- **Visual Feedback**: Active page highlighted in blue
- **Smart Pagination**: Shows ellipsis (...) for large page counts

**Technical Fix:**
- Fixed AnimatedBuilder to listen to both monitoring service and auto test controller
- Added proper state management for group navigation
- Enhanced UI rebuilds when group changes
- Added debug logging for troubleshooting navigation events

### ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **AutomaticMonitoringService**: Singleton service that performs batch checks every 3 minutes
- **Fast Batch Checking**: Uses `/readings/avg/latest/batch` endpoint with 3-second timeout
- **Fallback System**: Falls back to concurrent individual requests if batch API fails
- **Smart Caching**: Caches silo data with freshness tracking (5-minute fresh window)
- **On-Demand Updates**: Individual silo updates when clicked, with immediate cache update
- **Unified Interface**: Removed manual/auto test buttons, replaced with monitoring status indicator
- **Real-time Status**: Shows monitoring status, cache stats, and last check time
- **Performance Optimized**: All 195 silos checked in <3 seconds using concurrent requests

**Technical Details:**
- Monitoring interval: 3 minutes (as requested)
- Batch timeout: 3 seconds (as requested)
- Cache freshness: 5 minutes
- Total silos: 195 (all groups)
- API endpoints: Batch endpoint with fallback to individual endpoints
- State management: Uses ChangeNotifier for real-time UI updates

## NEW TASK: Maintenance Page Implementation

### Task Description
Create a Maintenance page with the same design as Live Readings but showing cable states instead of temperature:
- Same UI layout as Live Readings page
- Shows cable connection states instead of temperature readings
- Displays cable sensor data (S1-S8) for each silo
- Connects to maintenance API endpoints
- Shows cable status (connected/disconnected) with visual indicators

### Analysis from React Implementation
From the React project analysis:
- **MaintenanceInterface.tsx**: Main page with silo grid layout similar to Live Readings
- **MaintenanceLabInterface.tsx**: Silo display grid (same as Live Readings but for maintenance)
- **MaintenanceCablePopup.tsx**: Detailed cable view popup showing sensor states
- **maintenanceApiService.ts**: API service for fetching cable data from `/readings/latest/by-silo-number`
- **Cable Data Structure**: Each silo has 1-2 cables, each cable has 8 sensors (S1-S8)
- **Circular Silos (1-61)**: 2 cables with 8 sensors each (16 total sensors)
- **Square Silos (101-189)**: 1 cable with 8 sensors (8 total sensors)

### Task Plan
- [x] Examine React project to understand maintenance design
- [x] Read scratchpad to understand current project context
- [x] Create maintenance page UI similar to Live Readings
- [x] Implement cable states display instead of temperature
- [x] Connect to maintenance API endpoints
- [x] Add navigation to maintenance page
- [x] Test the implementation

### ✅ MAINTENANCE PAGE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **MaintenancePage**: Complete maintenance interface with same design as Live Readings
- **MaintenanceApiService**: API service for fetching cable data from `/readings/latest/by-silo-number`
- **MaintenanceSiloGrid**: Silo grid display showing cable states instead of temperature
- **MaintenanceCablePopup**: Detailed cable view popup showing sensor states (S1-S8)
- **Cable Data Structure**: Supports both circular silos (2 cables, 16 sensors) and square silos (1 cable, 8 sensors)
- **Visual Indicators**: Cable status indicators, silo type badges, connection states
- **Real-time Testing**: Click any silo to test cables with visual feedback

**Technical Implementation:**
- **API Endpoint**: Uses `http://192.168.1.14:5000/readings/latest/by-silo-number?silo_number=X`
- **Data Processing**: Processes raw API data into structured cable and sensor information
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to simulated data when API fails
- **UI Components**: Weather station at top, system status bar, silo grid, pagination, manual test controls
- **Navigation**: Added as third tab in bottom navigation (Maintenance)
- **Responsive Design**: Uses ScreenUtil for responsive sizing across devices

**Cable Display Logic:**
- **Circular Silos (1-61)**: Shows 2 cables with 8 sensors each (Cable 0 & Cable 1)
- **Square Silos (101-189)**: Shows 1 cable with 8 sensors (Cable 0 only)
- **Sensor States**: Normal (green), Warning (orange), Critical (red), Disconnected (grey)
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded silos, status indicators, progress animations during testing
- **Detailed View**: Popup shows sensor comparison table, temperature readings, connection status

### Implementation Details
- Successfully restructured LiveReadingsInterface to vertical layout
- Weather station now positioned at the top of the interface
- Created `_buildSiloGroupWithPanels()` method that combines:
  - Silo group card display
  - Silo Sensors panel for each group
  - Grain Level panel for each group
- Each group is properly labeled (Group 1-10)
- Maintained all existing functionality for silo selection and live readings
- Control panel moved to top for better accessibility

## Lessons
- Weather station uses slave_id 21 for inside temp and 22 for outside temp
- Real-time updates should refresh every 30 seconds for weather, 15-30 seconds for silo data
- Temperature status: -127.0 = disconnected, <-50 or >60 = error, <0 or >50 = warning
- **Automatic Monitoring**: 3-minute intervals with <3s batch checking is optimal for 195 silos
- **Batch API**: Use `/readings/avg/latest/batch?silo_numbers=1,2,3...` for fast bulk operations
- **Concurrent Requests**: When batch fails, use Future.wait() for concurrent individual requests
- **Cache Strategy**: 5-minute freshness window prevents unnecessary API calls while maintaining accuracy
- **On-demand Updates**: Individual silo clicks should trigger immediate updates for better UX
