# Mobile Silo Monitoring - Task Progress

## Current Task: Weather Station and Vertical Silo Layout

### Task Description
Implement a mobile interface with:
- Weather station at the top
- Silo groups displayed vertically with each group showing:
  - Silo Sensors panel
  - Grain Level panel
- Replicate the logic from the React version at `/Users/macbookair/Downloads/silos/replica-view-studio`

### Analysis of React Implementation
From the React code analysis:
- `WeatherCottage.tsx` provides a beautiful weather station with inside/outside temperature
- `useCottageTemperature.ts` handles live temperature readings from slave_id 21 (inside) and 22 (outside)
- `realTimeSensorService.ts` and `useLiveSensorData.ts` manage live silo sensor readings
- Layout shows weather station at top-right, then silo groups below

### Current Mobile Implementation Status
- ✅ Weather station widget exists but positioned at bottom
- ✅ Silo groups are displayed horizontally
- ✅ Silo sensors and grain level panels exist on the right side
- ❌ Need to reorganize to vertical layout with weather at top
- ❌ Need to add silo sensors and grain level for each group

### Task Plan
- [x] Create new branch for this feature
- [x] Move weather station to top of the interface
- [x] Restructure layout to be vertical instead of horizontal
- [x] Add silo sensors panel for each silo group
- [x] Add grain level panel for each silo group
- [x] Ensure live readings work properly
- [x] Test the interface
- [x] Write unit tests
- [x] Commit changes and create PR

### ✅ PREVIOUS TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**Branch:** `feature/vertical-weather-silo-layout`
**Commit:** 87c5cad - "feat: Implement vertical layout with weather station at top"

## NEW TASK: Auto-Test with Progress Indicators and Pagination

### Task Description
Implement auto-test functionality that:
- Scans all silos automatically (24 seconds per silo)
- Shows circular progress indicators on each silo during scanning
- Implements pagination to show one silo group at a time
- Tracks disconnected silos and retries them
- Provides visual feedback for scanning progress

### Analysis from React Implementation
- Auto-test scans all 195 silos with 24-second intervals
- Uses `setCurrentScanSilo()` to track currently scanning silo
- Shows progress indicators and retry logic for disconnected silos
- Persistent state management with localStorage
- Progress bar shows overall completion percentage

### Task Plan
- [x] Create new branch for auto-test feature
- [x] Implement pagination for silo groups (one group per page)
- [x] Add circular progress indicators for scanning silos
- [x] Implement auto-test controller with 24-second intervals
- [x] Add progress tracking and retry logic for disconnected silos
- [x] Update UI to show scanning status and progress
- [x] Test the auto-test functionality
- [x] Write unit tests
- [x] Commit changes and create PR

### ✅ PREVIOUS TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**Branch:** `feature/auto-test-pagination-progress`
**Commit:** 71f56f7 - "feat: Implement auto-test with pagination and progress indicators"
**PR:** https://github.com/basharagb/silos-mobile/pull/new/feature/auto-test-pagination-progress

## NEW TASK: Animated Actions and API Colors

### Task Description
Implement animated actions for grain level and silo sensors with API-based colors:
- Add animated actions to grain level display (pouring animation)
- Add animated actions to silo sensors (reading animation with blue overlay)
- Implement API-based silo colors instead of hardcoded colors
- Move pagination navigation to bottom under groups
- Add real-time sensor color updates from API

### Analysis from React Implementation
- GrainLevelCylinder shows pouring animation during readings with yellow gradient
- LabCylinder shows blue overlay and pulsing text during readings
- Silo colors come from API response (silo_color field)
- Sensor colors come from API (color_0 to color_7 fields)
- Animations use CSS transitions and pulse effects
- API provides both individual sensor colors and overall silo color

### Task Plan
- [x] Create new branch for animated actions feature
- [x] Update API service to fetch silo and sensor colors
- [x] Implement animated grain level with pouring effects
- [x] Add animated sensor readings with blue overlay
- [x] Update silo colors to use API data
- [x] Move pagination navigation to bottom
- [x] Add real-time color updates
- [x] Test animations and API integration
- [x] Write unit tests
- [x] Commit changes and create PR

### ✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**Branch:** `feature/animated-actions-api-colors`
**Commit:** cd2218f - "feat: Add animated actions and API-based colors"
**PR:** https://github.com/basharagb/silos-mobile/pull/new/feature/animated-actions-api-colors

### Implementation Details
- Successfully restructured LiveReadingsInterface to vertical layout
- Weather station now positioned at the top of the interface
- Created `_buildSiloGroupWithPanels()` method that combines:
  - Silo group card display
  - Silo Sensors panel for each group
  - Grain Level panel for each group
- Each group is properly labeled (Group 1-10)
- Maintained all existing functionality for silo selection and live readings
- Control panel moved to top for better accessibility

## Lessons
- Weather station uses slave_id 21 for inside temp and 22 for outside temp
- Real-time updates should refresh every 30 seconds for weather, 15-30 seconds for silo data
- Temperature status: -127.0 = disconnected, <-50 or >60 = error, <0 or >50 = warning
